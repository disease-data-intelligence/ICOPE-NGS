# NOTE: These are basic modules that are necessary for running python, accessing other modules and 
# monitoring jobs. 
# We will keep loading modules within the scripts to make sure we track versions correctly.

# anaconda has a samtools module which can interfere with the computerome version, thus we
# have to load it here to avoid conflict
